Purpose: This program takes an inputted file and reads
in the names in the file. Each name is used to create
a node that is then inserted into a linked list. In
addition, each name node will have a friends attribute
that, itself, links to another linked list containing
that name's friends. The user will input two names
into the program and the list of name(s) in common
will be returned.
